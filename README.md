# LowEndShader
It is my first project ever to attempt to create a shader. I have an extremely low end PC, which has a video card from, like 2006 (NVIDIA 8600GT). My aim is to create a shader for low end PCs.
However even with this I am approaching the limit of my computer. It is running with a terrible 30 fps. I hope that somebody help me with testing and even contribute to this project. Thanks.
